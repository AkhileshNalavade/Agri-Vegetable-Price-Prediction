Agri-Vegetable-Price-Prediction
AI-powered Price Prediction for Agri-Vegetable Market

This project aims to forecast daily prices of agricultural and vegetable commodities using Machine Learning. By training on over a year’s worth of historical data, the system captures seasonal patterns, regional differences, and price trends to assist farmers and traders in making informed, data-driven decisions.
